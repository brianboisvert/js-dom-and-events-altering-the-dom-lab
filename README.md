## Instructions

In this lab, you will be taking a look at the admin page for Scuber and make some alterations to the DOM using JavaScript.  

You will find your tests underneath the HTML after you run `learn-test`.  We'll be testing against this with the `index.html` document, but you should still write your code in `index.js`.  Write the following functions:

- Define a function `removeDowntown()`, which removes (as opposed to hides) the first `li` with the text "Downtown" from the list of top locations.
- Define a function `hideCompanyStrategy()` that hides the company strategy.  
- Define a function `showCompanyStrategy()` that shows the company strategy.  
- Define a function `changeTitle(title)` that accepts an argument of the title to change to, and then changes the `h1` on the page to that title.

Have fun, and good luck!
